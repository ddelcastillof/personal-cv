## About Me

I'm an MPH in Global Health student at the University of Washington. Also I'm a physician who obtained his MD in 2021 from the National University of San Marcos in Lima, Peru. Before joining the program, I worked since 2019 with the CRONICAS Center of Excellence in Chronic Diseases group at the Cayetano Heredia University in Peru. I am especially interested in the link between early risk factors in childhood and cardiometabolic disease development during adolescence and adulthood.
